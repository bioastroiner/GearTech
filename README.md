# Gregtech Lowlevel Edition
A rewrite of minecraft mod `gregtech` in C

## GamePlay Goal
to be as close to minecraft beta modded scene with ic2 withsome features from gregtech.

## How to Build?

### on windows
any compiler should work but i use gcc with MSCV and havent test others, you only need opengl as of now, other libs are built in to keep the project as lightweight as possible without the need of dependencies.
### on Linux
not compatible as of now since i am using windows.h for some lightweight windowing without the need of a crossplatform library, this will ofc change in the feature.
